This is the final project for my training as a software engineering intern at the Laboratory of Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP).
The project is a Neural Network playground that allows people to select parameters for a neural network, specifically the NEAT algorithm,
and see how the algorithm adapts depending on the user selected parameters. 

The NEAT algorithm was adapted from: https://github.com/Brennan-M/FlappyBird_NEAT_GeneticAlgorithm/tree/NEAT_Master
The NEAT algorithm was made by Kenneth Stanley who's paper can be found here: http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf
